# Luke Ledwich

Luke Ledwich is a grizzled engineer who has been making games since the last millennium.

A generalist at heart, Luke has taken a winding road into the game industry. Starting in Sydney with a degree in Mechatronics, they worked through academia and five other industries before breaking into games.

They are currently a staff engineer at Riot Games working on building gameplay systems for VALORANT and driving the engineering processes that keep a AAA studio thriving.

## Talks

Luke will start the event off with a keynote on the event and his experience. He will explore and define the theme of Galaxy Games Festival: Exploring New Horizon.

### 2:30PM | Opportunity Knocks | Room A

Opportunity knocks rarely and often quietly.

It is important to be listening and prepared to answer. Game career opportunities are rare, highly competitive and easily missed in the din of regular modern life. This talk is a journey into my experiences as an applicant and hiring manager in the games industry. I hope to impart some wisdom and insight that might help a listener grab one of these fleeting chances. It will cover ways to be prepared, avenues to hear about job opportunities and the strength of being flexible.I will also talk to the harsh realities of luck and the patience that may be required. Most importantly I hope to inspire the necessary courage to take the leap when opportunity knocks.
