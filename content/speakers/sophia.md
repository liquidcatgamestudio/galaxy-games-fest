# Sophia

My name is Sophia (Azusa in some online voids) and I'm a Quality Assurance Tester based in Sydney, Australia. Previously at Chaos Theory Games (Australian Studio of the Year 2024), and contracted to other well-known Aussie indies, I'm known for being a pest to development and design, with a meticulous eye for detail and being a loud (probably too loud) advocate for the player experience.

Currently working at Lucidity Loveworks, directing the visual novel ORACULUS, I'm doing a bit of everything from art, to dev, to writing, leveraging my experience in the games industry to create unique game experiences for theatre kids (just like me fr!).

## Talks

### 12:00PM | I've been isekai'd into the 2025 games industry and want to start in QA but don't know how: talk edition | Room B

So you're a level 0 student and want to get into games because you've been told by the starting pixie that QA is a good stepping stone - but how do you actually manage it?

In this talk, previously entry-level adventurer Sophia will run down strategies on how to get you there, what you need to be looking out for, and how to put yourself at the forefront as an entry-level applicant... as someone who has had experience doing it themselves in the current state of the Australian games industry.
