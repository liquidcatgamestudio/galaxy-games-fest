# Morgan Ridley-Smith

After two years in an engineering degree, Morgan decided to shift paths to embrace her true passion and pursue a career in writing music for games. She hasnâ€™t looked back. Game audio perfectly combines her love for games, systems thinking and creating music with the power to transport people to other worlds. Being deeply embedded within the Australian game development scene, Morgan has participated in multiple game jams and is currently working on her first commercial project 'Insignia' with studio Uppon Hill.
