# Morgan Ridley-Smith (She/Her)

After two years in an engineering degree, Morgan decided to shift paths to embrace her true passion and pursue a career in writing music for games. She hasn’t looked back. Game audio perfectly combines her love for games, systems thinking and creating music with the power to transport people to other worlds. Being deeply embedded within the Australian game development scene, Morgan has participated in multiple game jams and is currently working on her first commercial project 'Insignia' with studio Uppon Hill.

## Talks

### 11:00AM | Going Beyond the Basic Music Loop | Room B

Are you a game maker that chucks a simple music loop into your game and calls it a day? Or are you a musician but game engines feel like a big black box of unknowns and you don’t know how to implement music that is more interactive? This talk hopes to bridge the gap between game makers and music creators and demystify some of the tech that can help take us all beyond the simple loop.
