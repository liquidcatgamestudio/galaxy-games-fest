### 11:00AM | 10 Signs you’re ready to commit to your game idea | Room A

Falling in love with your prototype is easy - but how can you judge whether it’s “the one” you’re ready to commit years of your life to? Is it about interest from publishers, commercial viability and the addressable market? Or does it all just come down to the uniqueness of the idea, replayability and depth?

The answer is all these things and more. This session will introduce and discuss 10 clear signs that your prototype is ready for the next stage of the development cycle - the challenges, pitfalls and curveballs you’ll experience along the way, and the motivational tools you need to justify your faith in the game, so you can get it finished, get it released, and make the next one!
