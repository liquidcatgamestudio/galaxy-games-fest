# Learn More

Galaxy Games Festival is an event for emerging game developers.

We have students in programming, art and music showcasing their amazing projects on the day. Come see what your fellow students have created, play their game and support their journey into the game industry. Broaden your understanding on what the game industry encompasses with guest panelists doing talks throughout the day. We have people from many different areas of the games and adjacent industries, giving you a glimpse of what it is like to work in their field. Games, animation, design, art, music, research and more. 

We have guest speakers from all over Australia coming in to give their perspective on the industry. Need advice or simply interested in making games? Interested in knowing what it’s like to work in the game and animation industry? Want tips on making your portfolio stand out? Or, do you just really want to see professionals do their thing? We have it all, there is something for everyone. Don’t miss the chance to hear from developers in Riot Games, Unity, and many other studios coming to speak at our event.
