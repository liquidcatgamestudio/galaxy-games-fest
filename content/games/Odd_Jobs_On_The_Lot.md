# Odd Jobs: On The Lot

Odd Jobs on the Lot is a fun co-op simulation game set in everyday Australian car parks. Play as local animals like a kangaroo, koala, or platypus. Return shopping trolleys, deliver groceries direct to boot, clean up rubbish, wash cars, and more. Play solo or with up to four players in local co-op to complete quirky tasks and keep things running. Perfect for families, couples, or mates looking for a laugh, this game turns ordinary jobs into wild funâ€”with a true-blue Aussie twist!
