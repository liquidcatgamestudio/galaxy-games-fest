# Ooble Gardens

Play as a garden spirit summoned to create a fairy garden in a backyard for Oobles to live and interact with. Oobles are little spirits of nature that represent elements, each of them offering pieces of their ideal dream garden. Using the offerings they give you, place buildings and structures to give these little Oobles a new home!
