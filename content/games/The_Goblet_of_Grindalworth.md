# The Goblet of Grindalworth

We will be showcasing some of the works of the members of Pixel Pasture which includes a game demo and art portfolios. The game "The Goblet of Grindalworth" is a short adventure game that logs your story to a physical receipt which you can take with you when your run ends. Concept art, design ideation and storyboarding will also be showcased by our artists Aniko and Izzy. We're aiming to give insight into the development process for Pixel Pasture as a studio as well as detailing the events we run within the community to create connections.
