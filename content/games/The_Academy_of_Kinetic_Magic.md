# The Academy of Kinetic Magic

The Academy of Kinetic Magic is a 3D Fantasy Puzzle Platformer with Object Manipulation Abilities. Take on the academy exam by completing 15 levels across 5 different modules and try to get the highest grade! The game features 6 different abilities that can help the player solve various puzzles, including:

- Grab Ability: Move and rotate any interactable object
- Gravity Ability: Freeze objects in mid-air and move them around
- Clone Ability: Duplicate an object, copying all of its properties
- Scale Ability: Augment the size and weight of objects
- Rewind Ability: Freeze the world and move objects through time
- Fuse Ability: Attach objects together

Each Object Manipulation Ability can be used in various ways to solve puzzles and traverse environments. Use them to complete every level and achieve an S Grade!

This project was created as part of the UNSW course COMP3421 Computer Graphics, where as a group of 5 people we created a game in Unreal Engine in 10 weeks.
