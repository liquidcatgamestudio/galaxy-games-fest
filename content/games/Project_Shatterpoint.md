# Project Shatterpoint

Project Shatterpoint combines the fluid movement of Titanfall with the destruction of games like The Finals/Battlefield and the accessible pick-up-and-play multiplayer of Halo to create a movement shooter unlike anything else seen before.

- Grapple, slide and wallrun your way to victory in a fully destructible environment.
- Battle up to 12 players online in hectic, precise combat.
- Deploy towering battle mechs to (literally) level the playing field.

Get your friends, get online and get ready to deploy into the ultimate test of movement and combat skill!
