# Game One

We have students in programming, art and music showcasing their amazing projects on the day. Come see what your fellow students have created, play their game and support their journey into the game industry. Broaden your understanding on what the game industry encompasses with guest panelists doing talks throughout the day. We have people from many different areas of the games and adjacent industries, giving you a glimpse of what it is like to work in their field. Games, animation, design, art, music, research and more.
