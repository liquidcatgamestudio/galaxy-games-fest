# Sushi Dojo

Sushi Dojo is a charming and cosy idle game where players build, manage, and maintain their very own sushi train restaurant. Players earn money by serving a growing stream of hungry customers, then they can reinvest it to upgrade and personalise their restaurant. They can also unlock new dishes, decorations, and equipment. 

At the heart of the kitchen is the head chef, a skilled cat dressed in a karate gi, who crafts delicious sushi with love. Another key character featured in the game is a trusty robot assistant who zips around the restaurant, clearing tables and keeping things tidy. Together, the characters also construct essential items like tables, chairs, and conveyor belts to keep operations running smoothly as the restaurant starts to expand. 

We are a couple working on Sushi Dojo out of our shared love for Japanese culture, delicious food, and indie games. Our game is designed to be a laid-back experience that can be enjoyed in the background.
