# Lumin

Lumin is the ultimate platform for gaming highlight built for everyday gamers who want to capture and share their best in-game moments without the pressure of being a streamer. Whether it’s a clutch win, hilarious glitch, or emotional finale, Lumin turns these fleeting experiences into lasting memories. Think of it as a TikTok or Instagram feed—but exclusively for gaming.

We’re showcasing the live beta version of our mobile and web app, where users can upload clips directly from their devices, engage with a community feed, and even compete for prizes through tournaments and weekly clip challenges. Our recent campaign features a $10,000 tournament across Australian university clubs, making it the perfect case study in organic, player-driven growth.

At our display table, you’ll be able to:
	•	Explore the Lumin platform hands-on
	•	View some of the top clips from real players
	•	See how our social features and leaderboard system work
	•	Chat with the founders about our platform-agnostic design, community roadmap, and upcoming features like clip tagging, game discovery, and creator monetization.

Whether you’re a gamer, game dev, or just curious about how community-driven content is reshaping the way we experience games, we’d love to show you what we’re building.
