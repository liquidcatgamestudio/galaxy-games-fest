# Which Way Up: Galaxy Games

Which Way Up: Galaxy Games is a family friendly party game that gives unique freedom of movement by allowing you to run on walls and ceilings, orbit around planets, or fall across entire levels by manoeuvring through gravity fields.

Each of our 12 Gravity Games feature their own unique bite-sized challenge where up to 4 players can compete. Eject your friends into space as you race across gravity fields, score a goal with an entire moon, leap across planets to escape a black hole, capture and hold zodiacal constellations and much more!
