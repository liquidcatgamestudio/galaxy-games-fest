# Sigilbearers

Sigilbearers is a trading card game that has been in the works for about 2-3 years. It plays similarly to and is inspired by games such as Yu-Gi-Oh, Inscryption and Magic: The Gathering. 

In this game, you must play a variety of creature and spell cards to bring your opponent's life down to 0, strategically using the 3 attacking slots and 3 defending slots you are allocated. The main feature of Sigilbearers is the collection of Sigils, which all have unique passive effects that trigger periodically throughout the game.

Currently, we have completed our base set and are slowly developing our second set, introducing new keywords, new Equipment spells and Split-typed cards which open the doors for new and interesting synergies alongside a plethora of new and exciting archetypes to experiment with.

The game is playable exclusively on Tabletop Simulator for the time being, with a possibility of producing physical cards in the distant future.
