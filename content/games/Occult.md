# Occult

Occult is a gothic deckbuilding roguelike with a variable-turn system where playing cards advance the enemy’s turn. Conquer rival cults and monstrous horrors to ascend to the realm of godhood in a decaying, abandoned world.

God has died, and left their Throne empty. Without them, the world is falling into ruin, with powerful entities forming cults in a bid to take the Throne. You are the Chosen of one such entity, and fated to leave this dying world behind as a pawn in the grand struggle.

Features: 
Variable turn system: playing cards costs “time” instead of resources, and the actions of each enemy are tied to a timer. The turn order constantly changes as enemies take different actions, keeping you on your toes.

Skills: Your patron has granted you abilities that do not advance time when used, but require sacrificing cards from your hand. Find use for unwanted cards and pull off last-minute actions by using them instead. 

The current build showcases the core combat system with 3 levels (easy, medium, hard)
