# Viva La Grind

Viva La Grind is a movement-action game, where the player must use their stylish movement skills to free their city from a mechanised corporation.

Grind on rails, ride along billboards and boost through the air with the help of a pair of high-tech roller blades! Use the environment and your movement skills to reach your enemy’s weak spots and bring them down!

The game is a blend between flow-state extreme sports games (Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, Tony Hawk's Underground) and spectacle-focused combat games (Shadow of the Colossus, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance). The core design pillar of the game is ‘Movement is Combat’: with stylish movement allowing you attack enemies, and those enemies giving you more traversal options.  

Viva La Grind started life as a student project from the Academy of Interactive Entertainment (AIE) Advanced Diploma course. From there, it has been taken into the ‘Games for Business’ Graduate Diploma course at AIE to expand into a full commercial release.
